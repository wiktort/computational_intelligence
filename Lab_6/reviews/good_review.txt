I was travelling along with my family. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Holiday Inn Limehosue, London. The stay was comfortable and also leisurely. We had an excellent experience there.
I was travelling along with my infant, twin sons. Since children require extra care and also a lot of patience, the staff at Holiday Inn Limehouse was extremely helpful.
Whenever my children (1.5 Years Old) would get cranky and run along the corridors, all of the above mentioned ladies would come to our rescue :-). The friendliness and maturity of all the aforesaid staff impressed me and my wife. They helped us with patience and without any complaints. That was the cherry on the top. As I write down this review, i remember how Mihaela used to provide breakfast to my little son and make him smile. Thanks A Million Times Mihaela. Whenever i needed guidance on tours and commute, it was Muni and Tina who used to guide us. Kudos to both of you.
Hajni, Ileana, Aline, and Alexandra all of you are very nice girls. Thanks for making our stay all the more enjoyable.
The room provided to us was very comfortable. I requested (three months prior to my arrival), to the team to provide me an extra bed, as I was travelling with family, I was glad even before arrival that they made all the arrangements for that. I would give the Hotel brownie points for that. A special shoutout to booking.com for ensuring this.
