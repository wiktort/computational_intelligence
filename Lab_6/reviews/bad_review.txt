 I booked 3 rooms for 3 nights. All the rooms were not cleaned, sheets not Changed, towels not changed, bins not emptied after the first night even though the cards were left at the doors that the rooms are ready for house keeping. When we returned in the night I complained about it and all we got given were clean towels and still had the dirty towels in the rooms until the next day. On day 2 of our stay, before we went out I went to the reception and verbally told them of our experience the night before and asked if the rooms could be cleaned before our return in the night. We came back that night only to realise that the though clean towels were provided, the beds were only laid without changing the sheets nor hoovering the carpets in 2 rooms. The only room that was cleaned properly was the third room which we still had booked for another night but because we had taken the luggage from that room, they thought we had moved out. The most annoying part was that, we had left  some groceries in that room thinking we were going to have them when we returned from our trip in the night. These were neatly stashed away and clearly separated from the rubbish but they got rid of them without even checking if the room was still booked or free. I bitterly complained about it the next morning and all I was told was to look into their fridge and get some of their snacks and they will look into it and send me an email later. It’s been 5 days now and yet to receive that email. I will never go back or recommend to anyone. My personal experience, might be different from someone else’s but we did not enjoy our stay.
